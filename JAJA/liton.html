        Here is rough timeline of me.<br />
        from 2022 fall semester, I'm majoring Visual Communication Design in
        Seoul National University, in South Korea. Before this, I finished BFA,
        Scenography in Korea national university of art, I've worked in the
        movie, drama industry for 2 years as a costume designer. and now this
        year(2023), finally movies that I've participated in are all release. my
        first work was Squid Game on Netflix, during filming this, I had a
        serious car accident in which I've almost died. The second movie is
        Killing Romance (킬링 로맨스), it will be released on April, 14th. one
        of head-designer offered me to do a costume design in pre-production
        process and I happily took part in this movie. Scenario is hilarious,
        genre is romantic comedy. Plus, smugglers(밀수) will be released this
        summer, too. Costume work is quite different phase with other movies in
        Korea so I recommend you to watch this movie when it comes out! (but
        only for the time-killing. it doesn't have a meaningful context.)
